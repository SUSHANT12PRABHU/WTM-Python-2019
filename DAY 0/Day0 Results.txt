passwordFile = open('SecretPasswordFile.txt')
    secretPassword = passwordFile.read()
    print('Enter your password.')
      typedPassword = input()
    if typedPassword == secretPassword:
        print('Access granted')
    if typedPassword == '12345':
        print('That password is one that an idiot puts on their luggage.')
    else:
        print('Access denied')

Understanding :

So ,the above code elicits the validation of password stored in SecretPasswordFile.txt against the possible Correct values and values for which the condition is stated in the if statement.

1. Point to note is that the SecretPasswordFile.txt is not closed ( needs to be closed as a good coding practice ).

2. The Statements Access granted and Access denied may both get printed in case the password is other than 12345 which makes no sense ,instead would be better to use ( if elif else ) as switch is not available in Python.
